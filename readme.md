# Cool Enough to Code? Python Lessons and Code Samples

Cool Enough 2 Code? started as a simple idea: create a place for people to learn to code. We are a community of volunteers and learners that come together to learn about code. We are not simply another online learning site, rather want to make a difference by learning to code both interactive and accessible to anyone that wants to learn. We are people first, technology second. 

For more information check out our website and check out the individual lessons for links to the video.
